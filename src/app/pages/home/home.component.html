            <p>League Index is a performance analytics tool for League of Legends players that provides personalized champion rankings based on actual gameplay data. Using a customizable composite scoring system, it analyzes match history across multiple metrics like KDA, farm, vision, and damage to help players discover which champions they truly perform best with. The application features interactive visualizations, role-based filtering, and data-driven recommendations tailored to individual playstyles rather than generic tier lists.</p>

            <p>Salvage Auction Estimator is a bidding calculator designed for buyers at Copart and IAAI salvage vehicle auctions. It calculates all-in costs including auction fees, estimated repairs based on damage level, and transport expenses to determine maximum bid amounts at various profit margins (10%-25%). The tool helps users avoid overbidding by providing data-driven recommendations that factor in clean title values, repair methods, and total acquisition costs before placing a bid.</p>

            <p>This piece is a work in progress on a financial application I've considered for financial budgeting and management. I'm taking the mobile-first approach to building this application, as there is potential to create it as a web-based application as well.

            <p>This was a redesign of an enterprise product with a budget of over one million dollars. I was the UX architect for this application as I conducted usability tests, evaluations, and analyses and presented findings to the product owners, managers, and development team. I took responsibility for the interface design by presenting concepts, wireframes, app flows, and prototypes as needed. I also performed the UI development of this application within angular.</p>

            <p> I helped design and build an admin application at FindLaw. This secondary application was used to set values and parameters for its parent application. I took responsibility for the interface design. I also performed the UI development of this application within angular with the help of a couple of others on this project team. We created this application in a short time frame while learning how to customize and integrate angular materials.</p>
