Reflow was Adobe's experimental approach to visual responsive design—allowing designers to create fluid layouts with real breakpoints and CSS output. The product was eventually discontinued, and many of its concepts evolved into what became Adobe XD.<br><br>I was an early adopter of Reflow during its beta phase, using it to design responsive layouts at a time when responsive web design was still a relatively new concept. These examples represent some of that early exploration into breakpoint-based design and fluid grid systems before the modern design tools we use today were available.</p>",
