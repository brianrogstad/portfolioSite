The goal was to practice mobile UI patterns, work with XD's prototyping features, and design a clean, functional interface for displaying weather data.<br><br>As a self-directed learning exercise, this project helped me get comfortable with XD's artboards, component systems, and interactive prototyping. The simple concept of a weather app allowed me to focus on the fundamentals of mobile design: clear typography, intuitive information hierarchy, and touch-friendly interface elements.</p>",
