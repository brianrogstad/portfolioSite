# Portfolio Site — Project Vision

**Live since:** ~2010 (16 years), rebuilt Feb 2025 with Angular 18
**Purpose:** Personal statement of my design and development expertise

## Vision

This portfolio is **not** a marketing website designed to maximize conversions. It's a **reflection of who you are as a designer and developer** — a showcase of work you're proud of, built with the same care and attention to detail you bring to everything you make.

The portfolio proves three things:
1. **You can build** — Modern Angular 18 stack, SSR, semantic HTML, responsive design
2. **You care about quality** — Hand-crafted CSS, accessibility-first approach, meticulous SEO
3. **You understand the craft** — Every decision (tech stack, CSS strategy, a11y approach) reflects intentional choices

## User Journey

**Your ideal visitor:** Potential employers or peers reviewing your work during an evaluation.

**Their journey:**
1. Land on homepage → quickly understand what you do
2. Browse project showcase → see work samples, understand quality bar
3. Click a project → read detailed case study, see results and thinking
4. Learn about you → understand your values and approach
5. Leave impressed → confident in your capabilities

**Success:** They understand you're thoughtful, skilled, and care about doing things *right*.

## Design & Development Principles

### Authenticity Over Perfection
- Show real work (successes and challenges)
- Explain your thinking, not just final results
- Keep it genuine — this reflects your taste and standards

### Accessibility as Standard
- Semantic HTML that works without CSS/JS
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance or better
- Keyboard navigation throughout
- Tested with screen readers
- **Why:** Accessibility is good design, and this is a showcase of good design

### Performance & Efficiency
- Server-side rendering (SSR) for fast initial load
- Lazy-loaded components and images
- Modern web standards (Angular 18, no legacy cruft)
- Semantic HTML reduces JavaScript bloat

### Visual Craft
- Hand-crafted CSS (no framework bloat) — you wrote it, you own it
- Consistent design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Careful whitespace and typography choices
- Dark theme that respects user preferences

### SEO as Quality Signal
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper meta tags and Open Graph
- Performance optimized for Core Web Vitals
- Sitemap and robots.txt maintained
- **Why:** Good SEO is a side effect of good fundamentals — if the SEO is right, the structure is right

## Monetization Strategy

**Current Status:** No monetization (and no plans to add it)

**Why:** This is a portfolio, not a product. Its value is in demonstrating your capabilities. Adding ads, affiliate links, or paywalls would undermine that message.

**Future consideration:** If you add a blog or content section, consider light monetization (affiliate links for recommended tools, not intrusive ads).

## Key Values

| Value | How It Shows |
|-------|-------------|
| **Craft** | Hand-written CSS, meticulous component structure, attention to details |
| **Quality** | Accessibility first, performance optimized, semantic HTML |
| **Authenticity** | Real projects, honest case studies, your taste evident |
| **Simplicity** | No unnecessary complexity, fast to load, easy to navigate |
| **Professionalism** | Polished UI, clear writing, responsive design, works everywhere |
