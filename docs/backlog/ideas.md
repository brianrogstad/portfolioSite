# Ideas & Brainstorm

Raw ideas and concepts, not yet vetted or researched. This is a holding area for possibilities.

## Brainstorm Rules

- **Capture everything** — No idea is too early or too wild
- **No judgment** — Quantity before quality
- **No filters** — Some ideas are intentionally bad
- **Add context** — Who suggested it? When? Why?
- **Revisit quarterly** — Ideas mature over time

## Examples (For Reference)

### Example 1: "Redesign" Brainstorm
```markdown
## Portfolio redesign with 3D elements

**Category:** Design
**Status:** Brainstorm
**Suggested by:** Yourself (inspiration from portfolio showcase)
**Date:** [When did you think of this?]

**The idea:**
Add subtle 3D effects or animations to project cards. Maybe tilt effect on hover, or pseudo-3D depth.

**Why it might be good:**
- Modern, eye-catching
- Differentiates portfolio from typical design sites
- Shows technical chops (CSS/Canvas)
- Could be impressive in job interviews

**Questions to figure out:**
- [ ] How to do this responsibly (no seizure risk, respect prefers-reduced-motion)
- [ ] Would it help or distract from the actual project work?
- [ ] Is hand-crafted CSS enough or need WebGL?
- [ ] Performance impact?

**Related ideas:**
- Dark/light theme toggle (visual refresh)
- Animation library exploration
- CSS animation deep-dive

**Notes:**
This is interesting but maybe overthinking it. Portfolio should focus on content, not flashiness.
```

### Example 2: "Business Model" Brainstorm
```markdown
## Productize portfolio as a tool

**Category:** Business
**Status:** Brainstorm
**Suggested by:** Future thinking
**Date:** [When captured?]

**The idea:**
Turn portfolio site into a tool others can use to build their own portfolios. Like Webflow for designers' portfolios.

**Why it might be good:**
- Revenue opportunity
- Validates your design/dev skills
- Market demand (everyone needs portfolio)
- Could be recurring SaaS

**Questions to figure out:**
- [ ] Is there demand? (Wix, Squarespace, Webflow already exist)
- [ ] What would differentiate yours?
- [ ] How much engineering to make it self-service?
- [ ] Would it distract from other projects?

**Related ideas:**
- Team Dashboard productization
- Portfolio as portfolio piece (what you're already doing)

**Notes:**
Interesting long-term but not for now. Focus on monetizing League Index and Collected first.
```

### Example 3: "Content" Brainstorm
```markdown
## Video tutorials series

**Category:** Content
**Status:** Brainstorm
**Suggested by:** Personal interest
**Date:** [When captured?]

**The idea:**
Create short video tutorials (5-15 min) on topics you care about: CSS, Angular, accessibility, design thinking, etc.

**Why it might be good:**
- Different content format (variety)
- YouTube channel = audience building
- Drives traffic to portfolio
- Establishes expertise
- Could monetize with ads/sponsors later

**Questions to figure out:**
- [ ] What topics do you actually want to teach?
- [ ] Time commitment (scripting, recording, editing)?
- [ ] Where host? (YouTube, website, both?)
- [ ] Would it cannibalize blog idea?

**Related ideas:**
- Blog section
- Thought leadership positioning
- Content marketing strategy

**Notes:**
Interesting but big time commitment. Might wait until League Index generates revenue.
