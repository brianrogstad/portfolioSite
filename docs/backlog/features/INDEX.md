## Prioritization Framework

**Before scheduling a feature, ask:**

1. **Does it align with portfolio purpose?**
   - YES → Consider it
   - NO → Reject

2. **Does it improve user experience?**
   - YES → Continue
   - NO → Nice-to-have at best

3. **Is ROI clear?** (time investment vs benefit)
   - YES → Prioritize high
   - NO → Lower priority

4. **Is it low effort?** (< 4 hours)
   - YES → Consider now
   - NO → Schedule for later or reject

## Feature Request Process

**During quarterly triage:**
- **Approved:** Move to ROADMAP.md phase file
