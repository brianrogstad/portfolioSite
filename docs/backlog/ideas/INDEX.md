# Ideas & Brainstorm

Raw ideas and concepts, not yet vetted or researched. This is a holding area for possibilities.

---

## Brainstorm Rules

- **Capture everything** — No idea is too early or too wild
- **No judgment** — Quantity before quality
- **No filters** — Some ideas are intentionally bad
- **Add context** — Who suggested it? When? Why?
- **Revisit quarterly** — Ideas mature over time

---

## How to Capture Ideas

1. Copy `_TEMPLATE.md` to create a new file: `idea-name.md`
2. Fill in rough concept and questions
3. Set status to "Brainstorm"
4. Revisit during quarterly reviews
