# Backlog Index

Intake queue for work that's not currently scheduled. Ideas, bugs, tech debt, and feature requests go here.

---

## How Backlog Works

**Workflow:** Ideas → Captured in backlog → Triaged quarterly → Scheduled (or rejected)

**Files in this folder:**
- `bugs.md` — Reported issues and broken features
- `tech-debt.md` — Internal code quality improvements
- `features.md` — Feature requests and enhancements
- `ideas.md` — Brainstorm, unvetted concepts

**Principles:**
- Don't let ideas die — capture them here
- Quarterly triage decides what gets scheduled
- High-priority items move to ROADMAP.md
- Low-priority items stay in backlog (or archived)
- Nothing is "no," just "not now"

## Current Backlog Status

### Bugs
- No critical bugs (site is stable)
- See `bugs.md` for any reported issues

### Tech Debt
- See `tech-debt.md` for internal improvements
- None are blocking development

### Features
- See `features.md` for requested enhancements
- Most are nice-to-haves, not essential

### Ideas
- See `ideas.md` for brainstorm items
- Unvetted, just captured for later consideration

## Next Triage

**When:** Quarterly or when backlog grows
**Who:** You (when reviewing portfolio progress)
**Questions to ask:**
- Does this align with portfolio purpose?
- Does it improve user experience?
- Is it worth the time investment?
- Should it move to active roadmap?
