# Backlog Index

Intake queue for work that's not currently scheduled. Ideas, bugs, tech debt, and feature requests go here.

## How Backlog Works

**Workflow:** Ideas → Captured in backlog → Triaged quarterly → Scheduled (or rejected)

**Folders in this directory:**
- `bugs/` — Reported issues and broken features
- `tech-debt/` — Internal code quality improvements
- `features/` — Feature requests and enhancements
- `ideas/` — Brainstorm, unvetted concepts

**Principles:**
- Don't let ideas die — capture them here in individual files
- Quarterly triage decides what gets scheduled
- High-priority items move to ROADMAP.md
- Low-priority items stay in backlog (or archived)
- Nothing is "no," just "not now"

## Current Backlog Status

### Bugs
- No critical bugs (site is stable)
- See `bugs/` folder for any reported issues
- Use `bugs/_TEMPLATE.md` to add new bugs

### Tech Debt
- See `tech-debt/` folder for internal improvements
- None are blocking development
- Use `tech-debt/_TEMPLATE.md` to add new items

### Features
- See `features/` folder for requested enhancements
- Most are nice-to-haves, not essential
- Use `features/_TEMPLATE.md` to add new features

### Ideas
- See `ideas/` folder for brainstorm items
- Unvetted, just captured for later consideration
- Use `ideas/_TEMPLATE.md` to add new ideas

## Next Triage

**When:** Quarterly or when backlog grows
**Who:** You (when reviewing portfolio progress)
**Questions to ask:**
